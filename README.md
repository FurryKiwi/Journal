# Journal
A simple journal application to keep track of whatever information a user would like to keep.
I built it to keep track of notes of what I'm studying and learning.

# Features
- Settings page.
- Documentation/Help page for reference to keyboard shortcuts.
- Search function to quickly search through the listbox.
- Searchable combobox for finding the font you want.
- Manual and auto-backup feature so user won't lose any entries.
- Restore feature if data gets corrupted/lost or deleted.

# Credits
Credit to rdbende for the azure theme, I've slightly modified and taken out the things the program doesn't use.
